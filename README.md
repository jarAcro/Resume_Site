# Chase Jarvis - Resume Website

## Overview
This project is a personal online resume created using **HTML** and **CSS** to present my professional experience, skills, and certifications. The site includes interactive features to provide a modern and engaging experience for visitors. But mostly because I found making a resume using web technologies to be better then using canva or word.

- **Custom Scrollbar**: A refined scrollbar design has been implemented to enhance the user experience.
- **Contact Information**: Easy access to my contact details, including email and location, with icons for a clean, structured look.
- **Audio Introduction**: A small audio file is embedded, allowing users to hear a brief introduction of myself.
- **References**: Professional references are displayed side by side for readability.


## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the website, including custom animations and media queries for responsiveness.
  - Flexbox and grid for layout and alignment.
